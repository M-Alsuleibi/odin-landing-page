# This is a capstone project of CSS-flex section on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) - [Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). 

For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

Do _not_ be afraid to use Google or go back to previous lessons to look something up. **In real life, professional developers use Google constantly for things that they have been doing for years.**

# Assignment:
1. Download the design images and take a look at what you’re going to be creating here.

    - Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
2. There are many ways to tackle a project like this, and it can be overwhelming to look at a blank HTML document and not know where to start. Our suggestion: take it one section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
3. For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. You’ll probably have to go back to the HTML once you start styling, but bouncing back and forth from the beginning will take more time and may cause more frustration. (Note: you don’t need to use more than one stylesheet. Using only one CSS file is adequate for this project).
4. Many of the elements on this page are very similar to things you saw in our flexbox exercises… feel free to go back to those if you need a refresher.
5. Do not worry about making your project look nice on a mobile device. We’ll learn that later.
